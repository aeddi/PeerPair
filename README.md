# PeerPair
## Tech demo of Multipeer Connectivity

Peer Pair is a tech demo to show how you can connect multiple iOS devices and Macs on a local peer-to-peer network (over Bluetooth or WiFi) using Apple's Multipeer Connectivity library. It will pair devices, so every device will be connected to ONLY one other device. To fully see this app, you will need 4 iOS devices running iOS 9+ or Macs running MacOS Catalina.

I developed this app to improve my understanding of this networking library, so if you'd like to see this in action in a production app, please try my game, What the Shell by LITE Games, available on the iOS App Store. This game uses the networking logic from this sample app.

***Note:*** Bluetooth connections do not work on iOS devices before iOS 12.
